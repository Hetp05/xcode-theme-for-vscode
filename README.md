* [macOS Modern Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davidbwaters.macos-modern-theme)

## Extra Tweaks

Copy & paste this into `setting.json`.

```json
{
    "window.title": "${dirty}${activeEditorShort}",
    "breadcrumbs.enabled": true,
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "editor.autoClosingBrackets": "always",
    "editor.minimap.enabled": true,
